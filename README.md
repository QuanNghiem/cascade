# vuexstore

I have created the component BankDashboard that can be reusable in other components. I'm adding the json file as an import (in a full web development setting, the file will be supply by the Rest API). 

As a user, I can view my transactions and the amount of charge and my remaining money. I can click on each transaction to further view related information.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```
